# UofT Machine Learning Assignments (Course #3253)

This repository contains hands-on assignments and projects completed as part of **Course #3253 – Machine Learning** at the **University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies**, within the **Artificial Intelligence Certificate Program**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The assignments cover core machine learning concepts, including:

- Introduction to machine learning and end-to-end project design  
- Classification (k-NN, logistic regression, decision trees)  
- Clustering and unsupervised learning (k-means, DBSCAN)  
- Model training, evaluation, and feature selection  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LLE)

## 🏁 Final Project: Predicting Power Outages from Weather Data

The final project explores how extreme weather conditions correlate with power outages. I built a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict outage events using historical time-series data and weather features.

The workflow includes:
- Feature engineering
- Model selection (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Time-based validation
- Performance visualization
